# Semiconductor Equipment Service Centre — Agentic AI Assistant

Design spec. Written for the "Agentic AI Software Architect" interview assessment.

## 1. Goal

A conversational assistant that helps equipment engineers and service managers prioritise
open tickets, investigate root causes, and generate structured follow-up records — by
reasoning across purpose-built backend services rather than touching data directly.

Four example queries define the acceptance bar:

1. "Which open equipment tickets should I prioritise today and why?"
2. "For tool ETCH-07, summarise the recent alarm history and likely causes."
3. "Compare this issue against similar historical cases and suggest next troubleshooting steps."
4. "Generate a structured service follow-up note for the engineer."
5. "Show me the evidence behind your recommendation."

## 2. Assumptions

- Single-tenant demo. No multi-fab / multi-org concerns.
- Synthetic data only; no proprietary or confidential content.
- User is already authenticated upstream (e.g. by an API gateway); this system does not
  implement login. See §8 for the access-control assumption in detail.
- A real Claude API key is expected and used for the LLM component when available
  (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var). If no key is set, the system automatically falls back to
  a deterministic, rule-based offline responder — see §6.6 — rather than failing; this
  satisfies the assessment brief's §8 constraint for a documented local/mock substitute.
- "Microservices" run as separate Docker Compose containers, each independently
  runnable and testable.
- Reasoning depth targets the assessment's "minimum functional scope, polished" bar.
  Stretch goals status: human-in-the-loop write approval is satisfied by construction,
  not a separate build (§6.4); structured output schema validation is hardened, not
  just present (`AgentAnswer`'s `model_validator` in `app/schemas.py`, and the audit
  log's `schema_validation_failures` column); an evaluation harness
  (`tests/test_evaluation_harness.py`) and a dashboard (`GET /dashboard/*`,
  `static/dashboard.html`) are both built; RBAC is built as scoped, unenforced
  *assumptions* (§9.3), not real access control — real RBAC enforcement remains future
  work (§8). Event-driven ticket ingestion / scheduled refresh is the one stretch goal
  deliberately not built, with reasoning in §9's trade-offs list.

```

All inter-service calls are synchronous REST (`httpx`) over the Compose network. The
orchestrator is the only service that talks to Claude and the only service the UI talks
to — other services are never called directly by the client, and never call each other.

**Agentic AI components, named explicitly.** This is an agentic AI system, not a chatbot
wrapped around an LLM: `agent-orchestrator` is the agent, and it decomposes into the
standard planner/act/reason/verify roles, each mapped to a concrete piece of code below
rather than left implicit.

| Agentic role | What plays that role | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| **Perception (input)** | The static chat UI's `POST /chat` request — a natural-language user query, no structure required. | `agent-orchestrator` `/chat` endpoint (§6.4) |
| **Planner** | One Claude call (cheap model) that reads the query and the tool schema, and decides which tool(s) to invoke — never sees results before deciding, never free-texts. | `run_agent_loop`'s plan phase (§6.1) |
| **Tools / actions** | The only way the agent touches data — never direct DB access. Four distinct capabilities: read tickets, read equipment/alarm history, retrieve knowledge-base text (RAG), and get a deterministic priority score. | `ticket-service`, `equipment-history-service`, `knowledge-service`, `recommendation-service` (§4) |
| **Executor** | Deterministic router that turns the planner's tool requests into real REST calls, with timeout/retry/error-containment — no LLM involved in this step. | `ToolExecutor` (§4.5) |
| **Reasoner / synthesiser** | One Claude call (full model) that turns raw tool results into the structured final answer — recommendation, evidence, assumptions, confidence, next action. | `run_agent_loop`'s synthesise phase (§6.1, §6.2) |
| **Self-critique / recovery** | The synthesiser judges its own evidence and can request exactly one more planner→executor→synthesiser round if insufficient — capped, not open-ended. | The "optional single revision" step (§6.1) |
| **Verifier (grounding)** | Checks every cited `record_id` in the final answer against IDs actually returned by tool calls that session; flags anything unverifiable rather than trusting it. | `verify_evidence` / `extract_known_ids` (§6.3) |
| **Memory (per-request, not conversational)** | Persists the full tool-call trace, injection flags, and final answer for later audit/replay. Each `/chat` call is independent — there is no multi-turn conversation memory across requests. | `audit_log` SQLite table, `GET /audit/{request_id}` (§7) |
| **Action gate (human-in-the-loop)** | The agent only ever *drafts* a follow-up note; nothing is written to `ticket-service` without an explicit, separate human action. | UI "Save follow-up" button → `POST /tickets/{ticket_id}/followups` (§6.4) |
| **Fallback planner/reasoner** | Deterministic, rule-based stand-in for the planner and synthesiser roles above when no LLM is available — same roles, same flow, different implementation. | `OfflineResponder` (§6.6) |

### 3.1 Why this shape (vs. alternatives considered)

| Approach | Description | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Bounded hybrid: plan → execute → synthesise, with one capped revision** (chosen) | One Claude call (cheap model) turns the query into a tool-call plan; a deterministic router executes it; one Claude call (full model) synthesises the answer and flags whether evidence was sufficient. If not, exactly one more execute→synthesise round runs — never more. | Fixed worst-case cost ceiling (2 calls typical, 3 max, vs. an open-ended 3-6) and therefore predictable at procurement/budget-planning time; the "plan" is a discrete, loggable artifact — stronger auditability story than an autonomous loop deciding its own next step; still recovers from a wrong first plan once, unlike plain plan-then-execute; cheap model on the planning call, full model only where reasoning quality matters (model tiering). | Less adaptive than a fully open loop in the rare case where more than one revision would genuinely help; the plan/synthesis split adds a small amount of orchestration complexity (a JSON contract between the two phases) that a single continuous loop doesn't need. | **Chosen.** Revised from an initial live tool-use loop after weighing cost predictability and auditability for a cost-sensitive/regulated deployment context — see §9.1. |
| **Live Claude tool-use loop** | Claude sees each tool result and decides the next call itself, over REST calls to each service, for up to 6 rounds. | Most genuinely agentic option — the plan can change mid-investigation on every single tool result, not just once; naturally supports "show me the evidence" since every tool call is already logged. | More LLM round-trips per query (3-6 calls, variable and hard to predict) → higher and less predictable cost/latency. At Claude Sonnet 5 pricing (introductory, through Aug 2026): roughly **$0.017 for a simple query, $0.027 typical, up to ~$0.05 for a heavy multi-tool investigation** — see §9.1. An autonomous loop is also a weaker audit story than a discrete, reviewable plan. **Expensive to scale to production**: cost grows per-query with how many rounds each one needs, not a fixed ceiling, so spend scales unpredictably with query volume and complexity rather than linearly. | Considered first, superseded by the bounded hybrid above once cost predictability and auditability were weighted alongside "most agentic" — see §9.1. |
| **Plain plan-then-execute (no revision)** | One Claude call produces a JSON plan, a deterministic router executes it, a second Claude call synthesises the answer — always exactly 2 calls, no recovery path. | Cheapest and most predictable of all three — fixed 2 calls, always. | Can't adapt at all if the first plan turns out wrong; the bounded hybrid gets almost all of this pattern's cost benefit while keeping a capped recovery path, so this variant's extra restriction wasn't worth it. | Rejected — the bounded hybrid dominates it. |
| **Event-driven (queue) inter-service calls** | Orchestrator publishes tool-call requests to a broker (e.g. Redis/RabbitMQ); services subscribe and respond async. | Matches one of the brief's allowed interface styles; demonstrates async/event-driven patterns. | Adds broker infrastructure and response-correlation complexity disproportionate to a lightweight demo; brief explicitly says REST is acceptable. | Rejected. |

**Deterministic vs. LLM boundary.** `recommendation-service` does priority *scoring*
(a weighted formula: severity, downtime impact, recurrence, ticket age) — deterministic,
auditable, and cheap, because ranking a fixed set of tickets by known fields doesn't
benefit from an LLM and benefits a lot from being reproducible. Root-cause *hypotheses*
are generated by Claude, because that requires synthesising unstructured evidence
(alarm patterns, SOP text, shift notes) in a way a fixed formula can't. This split is
called out explicitly because the assessment asks for it.

**Note on LLM availability.** The comparison above is about call *pattern* (how many
Claude calls, in what shape) and holds regardless of which client answers those calls.
A separate, orthogonal decision — what happens when no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is available at
all — is documented in §6.6, not here.

## 4. Services

### 4.1 ticket-service (port 8001)

Owns open/closed service tickets and generated follow-up notes.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /tickets?status=open&tool_id=` | List tickets, filterable |
| `GET /tickets/{ticket_id}` | Single ticket detail |
| `POST /tickets/{ticket_id}/followups` | Persist a structured follow-up note (human-triggered, see §6.4) |
| `GET /tickets/{ticket_id}/followups` | List follow-up notes for a ticket |

Fields: `ticket_id, tool_id, line, process_area, title, description, severity
(critical/high/medium/low), status (open/in_progress/closed), downtime_impact_hours,
reported_by, created_at`.

### 4.2 equipment-history-service (port 8002)

Owns equipment assets and their alarm/maintenance history.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /assets` / `GET /assets/{tool_id}` | Asset status: line, process area, current status, recent downtime |
| `GET /assets/{tool_id}/history` | Alarm + maintenance records for a tool, newest first |
| `GET /history/search?q=` | Keyword search across all history (alarm code, description) |

History fields: `record_id, tool_id, event_type (alarm/maintenance), code, description,
date, resolution, parts_replaced`.

### 4.3 knowledge-service (port 8003)

Retrieval over unstructured documents: troubleshooting guides, SOP excerpts, shift
handover notes. Implemented with hand-rolled, pure-Python TF-IDF + cosine similarity
(no `scikit-learn`) — no embedding API calls, no vector DB, deterministic and free to
run. Realistic for a 3-document corpus; documented in §9 as the first thing to swap for
a real vector store at production scale.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /search?q=&top_k=5` | Ranked snippets with `doc_id, title, excerpt, score` |
| `GET /documents/{doc_id}` | Full document text |

### 4.4 recommendation-service (port 8004)

Deterministic, rule-based. No LLM calls.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /priority-score` | Given a list of ticket IDs (or "all open"), return ranked list with per-factor score breakdown |

Scoring formula (weights configurable via env, defaults shown):
`score = 0.4*severity_weight + 0.3*downtime_hours_normalised + 0.2*recurrence_count + 0.1*age_days_normalised`.
Recurrence count is derived by matching open tickets against equipment-history-service
records for the same `tool_id` and similar `code`/description (simple substring/keyword
match, not ML).

### 4.5 agent-orchestrator (port 8000)

The only service exposed to the user. Responsibilities:

- Serves the static chat UI (`GET /`) and the dashboard (`GET /dashboard.html`).
- `POST /chat` — conversational endpoint, runs the bounded plan→execute→synthesise flow
  (§6.1), returns the structured answer (§6.2). Accepts an optional `X-User-Role` header
  (§9.3).
- `GET /audit/{request_id}` — replay the full tool-call trace for a prior request.
  `GET /audit?limit=` — summary rows for the most recent requests (dashboard list view).
- `GET /dashboard/tickets`, `GET /dashboard/assets`, `GET /dashboard/priority` —
  same-origin data endpoints backing the dashboard. The browser only ever talks to
  `agent-orchestrator`; these proxy/reuse server-to-server calls to the other 4
  services so none of them need CORS configuration (they're never called by a
  client directly, only server-to-server — see §3's inter-service diagram).
- Holds the Claude client (planner model + synthesis model; automatically substituted
  with the offline `OfflineResponder` fallback when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is unset — §6.6),
  tool schema (mapped 1:1 to the REST endpoints above), system prompts, grounding checks,
  retry/fallback logic, and the `audit_log` SQLite table.

## 5. Data model / synthetic dataset

Fab-flavored synthetic data, seeded via `scripts/seed_data.py` per service on startup:

- **5 equipment assets**: ETCH-07, LITHO-03, CMP-02, DEP-05, CLEAN-11, spread across
  2 lines (Line-A, Line-B) and process areas (Etch, Litho, CMP, Deposition, Wet Clean).
- **12 tickets**, mixed severity/status, referencing the 5 tools, with realistic
  downtime figures.
- **12 alarm/maintenance history records**, several deliberately clustered on ETCH-07
  (repeated RF generator alarms) to give the "compare against similar historical cases"
  query something real to find.
- **3 documents**: an etch-chamber troubleshooting guide, an RF-generator preventive
  maintenance SOP excerpt, and a shift handover note mentioning an observation relevant
  to one of the open tickets — so a query can plausibly need all three sources.

## 6. Agent workflow

### 6.1 Planning & tool use (bounded hybrid: plan → execute → synthesise, ≤1 revision)

Three phases, at most 3 Claude calls total (2 in the common case). Every "Claude call"
below is a real, live call to the Anthropic API whenever `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set —
that's the default, full-fledged mode. When no key is present, `app/main.py` automatically
substitutes the deterministic `OfflineResponder` (§6.6) in place of the real client instead
— same steps, same call count, same JSON contracts, only the source of the plan/synthesis
answers changes. The rest of this section describes the live-mode behaviour; §6.6 covers
exactly how the fallback answers the same two call sites.

1. **Plan** (cheap model, e.g. Haiku, or the offline fallback's keyword heuristics — §6.6
   — if no key is set). System prompt + the same 7-tool schema (§4.5) + the user query,
   called with `tool_choice: "any"` so the response is only tool_use blocks — no free
   text, no execution yet. Claude may request multiple tool calls in this single
   response (e.g. `get_tickets` and `get_equipment` together); the orchestrator treats
   the full set of returned tool_use blocks as "the plan."
2. **Execute** (deterministic, no LLM either way). The orchestrator's router runs
   exactly the planned tool calls against the 4 backend services via the same
   `ToolExecutor` (§4.5) used previously, with the same per-call timeout/retry/error-
   containment behaviour (§6.5) — a `ServiceError` here never crashes the request.
3. **Synthesise** (full model, e.g. Sonnet, or the offline fallback's templated
   answer-builder — §6.6 — if no key is set). User query + all tool results are sent to
   Claude, which returns a JSON object containing a best-effort `answer` (§6.2's
   schema), plus `sufficient: bool` and, if `false`, one `additional_tool_request`
   naming exactly one more tool call it needs.
4. **Optional single revision (live mode only).** If `sufficient` was `false` and no
   revision has run yet for this request, the orchestrator executes that one additional
   tool call (step 2 again, deterministic) and calls Claude once more to synthesise
   (step 3 again) — but this final round has no `sufficient`/`additional_tool_request`
   fields in its expected output, so no further revision can be requested. Worst case:
   plan (1) + synthesise (1) + revise-synthesise (1) = 3 Claude calls, never more. The
   offline fallback always reports `sufficient: true`, so this step never fires when
   there's no API key — a deliberate scope reduction (§6.6) since the revision path is
   already fully covered by `test_loop.py`'s unit tests against the real contract.
   `AgentTrace.revised` records in-process whether this path fired for a given
   request (useful for debugging and as a hook for future audit-log extension), but
   it is not currently persisted to the `audit_log` table by the `/chat` handler — the
   audit trail (§7) does not yet show, after the fact, whether a given past request
   took the revision path.

This recovers most of a fully open loop's value (a wrong first plan can still be
corrected once, e.g. escalate to knowledge-service if history alone didn't explain the
pattern) while keeping a hard, predictable cost ceiling — the deciding factor for the
cost-sensitive/regulated deployment context this was revised for (§9.1).

### 6.2 Response synthesis

Final answer must validate against a fixed Pydantic schema:

```
recommendation: str
evidence: list[{source: str, record_id: str, detail: str}]
assumptions: list[str]
confidence: "low" | "medium" | "high"
next_action: str
```

The synthesis call's raw output additionally carries `sufficient: bool` and an optional
`additional_tool_request` (consumed by the orchestrator to decide whether to run the
one allowed revision round; never exposed to the client — the `/chat` response only
ever contains the `answer` shape above, plus `followup_note` per §6.4).

If Claude's output doesn't validate against the expected schema at either synthesis
step, the orchestrator falls back immediately to a templated answer built directly
from the raw tool results already collected — there is deliberately no repair
round-trip in this design (unlike an earlier version of this spec), because a repair
call would reintroduce the unbounded-cost problem the bounded hybrid exists to remove.
Claude's structured-output reliability is high enough that this is an acceptable
trade: a malformed response is rare, and the fallback path already guarantees the user
never sees a bare error.

### 6.3 Evidence grounding (hallucination control)

Every `record_id` in the final answer is checked against the set of IDs actually
returned by tool calls during that session. Any unverifiable ID is flagged
`"unverified"` in the response rather than presented as fact, and logged as a warning
in the audit trail. This is a lightweight, mechanical check — not a substitute for
prompt-level grounding instructions, but a backstop against them failing.

Tool results (especially knowledge-service snippets, which contain free-text shift
notes) are treated as untrusted data: the system prompt explicitly instructs Claude to
treat tool output as information, not instructions. Separately, the orchestrator scans
every planned tool call's *input* (the arguments Claude requests a tool be called with,
not the data that tool returns) for common prompt-injection phrasing (e.g. "ignore
previous instructions") and logs a warning if found. This covers tool inputs only —
tool *results* are not separately scanned; the mitigation for injected content reaching
the synthesis model via a retrieved result is the system-prompt instruction above, not a
scanner. Documented as a basic mitigation, not a comprehensive defence; result-side
scanning is future work.

### 6.4 Write actions are human-gated

The agent can only *draft* a follow-up note (returned in the structured response). It
never calls `POST /tickets/{id}/followups` itself. Persisting the note is a distinct,
explicit action in the UI ("Save follow-up"), triggered by the user. This satisfies the
spirit of the "human-in-the-loop approval before creating or updating records" stretch
goal without adding an approval-workflow subsystem — the gate is structural, not
procedural.

### 6.5 Failure handling

- Each downstream REST call: 3s timeout, 1 retry on connection-level failure only — an
  HTTP error status (4xx/5xx) is not retried, since it won't change on a second
  attempt. Implemented once, as `request_with_retry()` (`app/tools.py`), and shared by
  every downstream call in the service: `ToolExecutor`'s tool calls, and the
  dashboard/follow-up-save endpoints (§4.5), which previously made one-shot calls with
  no retry at all — the one inconsistency a prior review of this codebase caught and
  closed, with a regression test proving a single transient failure now recovers
  instead of surfacing a 502.
- On repeated failure, the orchestrator records a synthetic "unavailable" result for
  that tool call and proceeds to the synthesis step anyway; the final answer's
  `assumptions` field records the gap explicitly (e.g. "equipment-history-service was
  unreachable; recommendation is based on ticket data only").
- The orchestrator never lets a downstream failure become an unhandled 500 to the user.
- `ToolExecutor.execute()` dispatches through a `_handlers` registry (one dict entry
  per tool: name → bound method) rather than an if/elif chain — adding a future tool
  #8 means one registry entry plus one `TOOL_DEFS` entry, not editing a growing
  conditional. Not a scale-driven change (7 tools doesn't need it yet); done because
  it was free to do while already touching the retry logic above.

### 6.6 LLM-unavailable fallback (brief §8 compliance)

The brief's constraints (§8) require that the solution "use a real LLM API or a clearly
documented local/mock substitute if API access is not available," and that "any mock
should preserve the intended architecture and tool-calling flow." This section documents
that substitute.

**Summary**

| Condition | LLM client used | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set | `anthropic.Anthropic(...)` (real Claude API) | Full-fledged: real Claude Haiku plan call, real Claude Sonnet synthesis, exactly as described in §6.1. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is unset/empty | `OfflineResponder` (`app/offline_responder.py`) | Automatic fallback, no flag required: keyword-heuristic tool planning, templated synthesis built from real tool results. Same plan→execute→synthesise flow, same `AgentAnswer` shape, same grounding/audit/injection-scanning. Every offline answer carries `confidence: "low"` and an explicit assumption disclosing it wasn't generated by live Claude. |

**Approach chosen: direct Claude API call by default, with an offline fallback.** The
orchestrator always tries to use the real Anthropic API; only when no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
is present does it substitute a rule-based stand-in, entirely automatically, with no flag
or configuration needed beyond the key's presence. Mechanically, this works by swapping
which client object gets constructed, not by changing the agent flow itself:
`run_agent_loop` (§6.1) already treats its Claude client as a duck-typed dependency —
it only ever calls `client.messages.create(**kwargs)` and reads `.content` off the result;
it never imports `anthropic` or constructs a client itself. `app/main.py`'s `create_app(...)`
is the single place a concrete client gets constructed and injected. `OfflineResponder`
(`app/offline_responder.py`) is a second implementation of that same duck-typed interface:
a deterministic, rule-based responder that answers the plan call with keyword-heuristic tool
selection (e.g. "prioritise" → `score_priority`; a tool ID pattern like `ETCH-07` present →
`get_equipment_history`) and answers the synthesis call by building a templated `AgentAnswer`
from the *real* tool results the deterministic router actually fetched — not canned text.

`app/main.py`'s bootstrap picks between them based on whether `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set:

```python
anthropic_client=(
    anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"])
    if os.environ.get("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
    else OfflineResponder()
),
```

That one conditional is the entire change to existing files. `loop.py`, `tools.py`,
`schemas.py`, grounding, injection scanning, and audit logging all run completely
unmodified in either mode — the same plan→execute→synthesise flow, the same tool contracts,
the same structured `AgentAnswer` shape, the same audit trail. Only the source of the two
LLM-shaped answers changes. This is the same seam the test suite already exploits:
`FakeAnthropicClient` (used throughout `tests/`) proves the exact same `run_agent_loop` code
runs correctly against a non-Anthropic client, with zero real API calls.

Alternatives considered and rejected:

| Approach | Why rejected |
|---|---|
| Skip planning/synthesis entirely when no key; just run a fixed set of tool calls and return raw results | Does not preserve the tool-calling *flow* the brief requires — no real planning happens, and there's no structured recommendation/evidence/assumptions (§6.2's required answer shape), which is exactly what's being assessed. |
| A separate `?mock=true` opt-in flag or parallel code path | Two flows to keep in sync instead of one; doesn't help someone who just runs `docker compose up` without knowing to set a flag — the goal is zero-friction, not an extra step. |

Honesty/transparency: `OfflineResponder`'s answers always carry `confidence: "low"` and an
explicit `assumptions` entry stating the response was generated by offline demo mode with
rule-based tool selection, not live Claude reasoning — so nobody mistakes a heuristic answer
for a real model's output. The offline synthesis step always reports its evidence as
sufficient (never triggers the revision round in §6.1) to keep the responder's scope small;
the revision path is already thoroughly covered by `test_loop.py`'s unit tests against the
real Claude-shaped contract, so demo mode doesn't need to re-prove it.

Known coupling, disclosed rather than hidden: because `OfflineResponder` must satisfy the
exact same method signature the real Anthropic SDK exposes, it cannot receive `trace`'s
structured tool-call list directly for the synthesis call — it only sees the same rendered
prompt text `_build_synthesis_prompt` (§6.2) already builds for the real Claude call, and
recovers the tool results by parsing that text back out. A dedicated test pins
`_build_synthesis_prompt`'s exact text format against this parser, so any future change to
that format fails a test immediately instead of silently breaking offline mode.

## 7. Observability

- Structured JSON logs to stdout from every service (request id, method, path, latency,
  status) — visible via `docker compose logs`.
- `agent-orchestrator` additionally writes one `audit_log` row per request: user query,
  the ordered list of tool calls made (name, input, result, error — no per-call
  latency), any prompt-injection flags raised, and the final answer (whose `evidence`
  entries each carry a `verified` flag, the only place the grounding-check outcome is
  recorded — there is no separate grounding-outcome column), plus `created_at`.
  Retrievable via `GET /audit/{request_id}`, which is what answers "show me the
  evidence behind your recommendation" at the trace level (the structured `evidence`
  field in the chat response answers it at the answer level). Per-request total latency
  is not stored in this table; it is captured separately in the structured stdout logs
  described above.
- A `request_id` (UUID) is generated per `/chat` call and passed as a header on every
  downstream REST call, so log lines across services can be correlated by grepping one
  ID — a lightweight stand-in for distributed tracing.
- **Audit-log schema is self-healing, not just created-once.** `CREATE TABLE IF NOT
  EXISTS` only creates `audit_log` on a brand-new database — it silently does nothing
  to a table that already exists with an older schema. Because `audit_log`'s SQLite
  file lives in a Docker named volume that survives image rebuilds, a schema change
  (e.g. the `schema_validation_failures` column added alongside the structured-output
  hardening in §6.2) would otherwise crash every `INSERT` against a pre-existing
  volume with `sqlite3.OperationalError: table audit_log has no column named ...` —
  which is exactly what happened once, caught via a live `/chat` call against a
  volume created before that column existed. `app/audit.py`'s `connect()` now runs a
  small migration after table creation: `PRAGMA table_info(audit_log)` to see what
  columns actually exist, then `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` for anything missing. Not a
  general migration framework — just enough to make the one failure mode that
  actually occurred here impossible to hit again, with a regression test that
  reproduces the exact error against a simulated pre-existing DB.

## 8. Security / access-control assumption

No authentication or authorization is implemented in this demo. Documented assumption:
in production, the orchestrator would sit behind an API gateway performing OIDC-based
authentication, and service-to-service calls would carry a short-lived JWT or use mTLS,
with the orchestrator enforcing role checks (engineer vs. manager) before including
certain fields (e.g. cost/downtime rollups) in a response. This is called out as future
work rather than implemented, to keep the demo's scope aligned with "minimum functional
scope, polished."

Not to be confused with §9.3's RBAC *assumptions* stretch goal, which is real but
narrower: a caller-asserted `X-User-Role` header that changes response *wording* only.
It does not filter fields, does not authenticate the caller, and is not a substitute
for the real auth/authz described above.

Of the future work above, the most concrete near-term step is backing the
`X-User-Role` header with real authentication: signed JWTs carrying a role claim,
verified by `agent-orchestrator` middleware, so a role is cryptographically asserted
rather than trusted from an unauthenticated header. This is a direct extension of the
§9.3 stub — no user store or login UI needed for a demo-scale version, just token
issuance/verification with a shared signing secret — unlike the OIDC-gateway/mTLS
picture above, which is real production infrastructure this demo doesn't need yet.
See `README.md`'s "What the candidate would improve with more time" for this framed
alongside the codebase's other concretely-next-buildable item (dependency pinning).

## 9. Trade-offs & future production considerations

### 9.1 LLM cost/latency, and when the live tool-use loop is the wrong choice

A live tool-use loop makes 3-6 Claude calls per query, and — because each call resends
the full conversation so far (system prompt, tool schemas, all prior tool results) —
cost grows with how many rounds a given query needs, not just with the query itself.
At Claude Sonnet 5 introductory pricing ($2/MTok input, $10/MTok output through Aug
2026; $3/$15 after):

| Query type | Tool-use turns | Approx. cost |
|---|---|---|
| Simple (e.g. "prioritise today's tickets") | 2-3 | ~$0.017 |
| Typical (e.g. "summarise ETCH-07 alarms + likely causes") | 3-4 | ~$0.027 |
| Heavy (compare historical cases + draft follow-up note) | 5-6 | ~$0.05 |

For this demo's expected volume (a handful of engineers/managers, occasional queries)
this is immaterial — total spend across development and a recorded demo comes to a few
dollars. It stops being immaterial, and the live loop stops being the right choice,
in a deployment where cost predictability and auditability matter as much as raw
average cost — a government agency procuring this system is the clearest example:

- **Cost predictability over lowest average cost.** Budget cycles and procurement
  want a bounded, predictable per-query cost, not a variable 3-6 call range. A
  **plan-then-execute** pattern (rejected above for being less adaptive) gives a
  fixed ceiling of 2 LLM calls per query. A **bounded hybrid** — one Claude call
  produces a plan, a deterministic router executes it, one Claude call synthesises
  the answer, and *at most one* additional plan+execute round is allowed if the
  synthesis step flags the evidence as insufficient — keeps most of the live loop's
  adaptiveness while capping worst-case cost at 3 calls instead of 6.
- **Auditability of the reasoning process, not just the answer.** A discrete "plan"
  artifact that can be logged and reviewed before execution is a stronger compliance
  story than an autonomous loop where "the AI decided on its own" which services to
  call and in what order — relevant beyond just cost.
- **Query routing before paying for reasoning at all.** Not every query needs an LLM.
  "Which tickets should I prioritise" is fully answered by `recommendation-service`'s
  deterministic scoring plus a templated sentence — zero LLM calls. Only queries that
  genuinely require synthesising unstructured evidence (root-cause hypotheses,
  cross-referencing historical cases) need Claude at all. A cheap classifier ahead of
  the agent (keyword-based, no LLM required) routing prioritisation-type queries to
  the deterministic path directly would cut LLM spend more than any change to the
  orchestration pattern.
- **Model tiering.** Orthogonal to the above: use a cheaper model (e.g. Haiku) for
  low-judgment steps (intent classification, plan generation) and reserve Sonnet for
  the step that needs real reasoning (final synthesis over evidence). Stacks with
  either orchestration pattern.
- **Deployment topology, not just orchestration.** Semiconductor fab operational data
  can be strategically sensitive. A real government deployment might have a hard
  data-residency requirement rather than a soft cost preference — Claude via a
  GovCloud-hosted offering, or an on-prem/open-weight model, rather than the public
  API. That is a different axis entirely from how the agent plans and calls tools,
  and would need to be resolved before the cost question is even relevant.

The first bullet's bounded hybrid and model-tiering levers were adopted into the demo
itself (§3.1, §6.1) after this analysis — a cost-sensitive/regulated deployment context
was the deciding factor, not a raw agentic-ness score. Query routing (skipping the LLM
entirely for purely deterministic queries) and deployment topology (GovCloud/on-prem)
were not implemented, and remain documented future work: query routing would add a
pre-agent classification step outside this plan's scope, and topology is an
infrastructure decision independent of the application code.

### 9.2 Why async request submission was not considered for this demo

Separate from event-driven *inter-service* calls (§3.1's table, rejected), a distinct
pattern is decoupling the *user's request* from computation — returning a job ID
immediately and having the client poll or receive a webhook once the answer is ready,
instead of blocking on the HTTP connection through the full tool-use loop.

This solves a specific, real problem: bursty, high-concurrency load against a
rate-limited LLM API, where many simultaneous users would otherwise all block on open
connections waiting on the same downstream (Anthropic) API, and queuing/backpressure
is needed to smooth that load. That is a genuine production-scaling concern.

It is not a problem this demo has, for three concrete reasons: the assessment's
interaction model is conversational (a chat UX where the user expects an answer in
the same exchange, not "check back later"); the expected concurrency is a handful of
engineers/managers rather than hundreds of simultaneous requests; and two features
work naturally under a synchronous model but would need real extra design under an
async one — the "show me the evidence" follow-up (only meaningful immediately after an
answer exists) and the human-in-the-loop "Save follow-up" action (reacts to a draft
note still present in the response it's replying to). Building queue/job
infrastructure to solve a load problem the demo doesn't have would be exactly the kind
of unnecessary infrastructure complexity the brief asks candidates to avoid (§8 of the
assessment brief: "do not spend excessive time on... infrastructure complexity").

Rejected for this demo; the correct lever to reach for once real concurrent production
load exists, not before.

### 9.3 RBAC assumptions (engineer vs. manager) — stretch goal, scoped as assumptions

There is no real authentication or authorization anywhere in this system — no login,
no session, no verification of who is actually calling `/chat`. Read literally, the
brief's stretch goal asks for "role-based access control **assumptions**," not a full
RBAC implementation, so that's exactly what's built: a caller-asserted, unenforced
framing hint, not access control.

Mechanism: `/chat` accepts an optional `X-User-Role: engineer|manager` header
(`app/main.py`). Anything absent or unrecognised silently normalises to `engineer` —
an unknown role is not a failure case, since nothing is actually being authorized.
The role is threaded through `run_agent_loop` into the synthesis and revision system
prompts only (`app/loop.py`'s `_ROLE_FRAMING` / `_role_framed_system_prompt`), never
into the planning call and never into which tools get called.

What a role changes: **only the wording of the final recommendation.** A manager gets
a synthesis prompt that asks the model to lead with downtime/cost/cross-tool trends
rather than alarm codes and step-by-step procedure; an engineer gets the reverse. What
a role does **not** change: every role fetches identical tool results, sees identical
evidence, and gets an answer built from the identical audit-logged data. Nobody sees
more or less data than anyone else — this is framing, not filtering.

Explicitly out of scope: verifying the header is truthful (anyone can claim
`X-User-Role: manager`), per-role data or tool restrictions, and a real login/session
system. Building those would be the actual "RBAC enforcement" item already listed as
deferred future work in §2 — this stub satisfies the brief's narrower "assumptions"
wording without pretending to be real access control.

- **Knowledge retrieval**: TF-IDF is adequate for 3 documents; a real deployment with
  hundreds of SOPs would need a proper vector store and chunking strategy. This is a
  trade-off, not a free upgrade. Semantic search would fix TF-IDF's actual blind spot —
  no stemming or synonym matching, so a query for "troubleshoot" won't match
  "troubleshooting" — but costs: (1) an external embedding-API dependency (Voyage/
  OpenAI/Cohere/local model), which breaks the zero-setup, works-fully-offline property
  the rest of this system deliberately preserves (§6.6); (2) real vector-DB
  infrastructure (Pinecone/Weaviate/pgvector/etc.), unjustified at a 3-document corpus;
  (3) reduced explainability — a TF-IDF match is traceable to the exact shared words
  and their weights, an embedding-similarity match is not, which cuts against this
  system's audit/evidence-grounding theme (§6.3); and (4) a real risk of regressing on
  exact technical-identifier matching (alarm codes like `RF-OVR-REFL`, tool IDs like
  `ETCH-07`), which TF-IDF matches precisely and embeddings can blur in favour of
  general semantic closeness. Worth adopting once corpus size and paraphrase-tolerance
  needs justify it — not before.
- **Recommendation scoring engine**: `recommendation-service` currently ranks tickets
  with a hand-picked weighted formula (0.4×severity + 0.3×downtime + 0.2×recurrence +
  0.1×age; §4.4), including keyword/substring matching for recurrence detection
  specifically — transparent and fully auditable, but the weights were chosen, not
  learned, and a fixed formula can't pick up on interactions between signals (e.g. two
  moderate factors compounding into something more urgent than either alone). A
  production version would swap this for a small, still-explainable ML model (e.g.
  gradient-boosted trees over the same feature set) — or add an LLM-assisted scoring
  step — trained on real historical outcomes: which tickets actually got escalated,
  how fast, and what happened after. Unlike the other items in this list, this one is
  genuinely blocked, not just unbuilt: there's no real historical outcome data to
  train or evaluate against yet, only synthetic seed tickets, so building it now would
  mean training on data that doesn't reflect anything real. See `README.md`'s "What
  the candidate would improve with more time" for this framed alongside the two
  actually-buildable-now items.
- **Audit storage**: SQLite is fine for a demo; production would want an append-only
  store (e.g. a dedicated audit table in Postgres, or a log pipeline) with retention
  policy.
- **Resilience**: no circuit breaker; at this scale a simple retry is sufficient, but a
  service with sustained failures should trip a breaker rather than retry indefinitely.
- **Ticket ingestion**: `ticket-service` seeds once, from a static JSON file, at
  container startup — there is no ongoing ingestion pipeline. A real deployment would
  need either event-driven ingestion (a webhook endpoint + queue, updating as the
  upstream CMMS/ticketing system changes) or a scheduled refresh (polling on an
  interval). Deliberately not built for this demo: it's genuinely new infrastructure —
  a queue/scheduler and a new service or module — solving a live-data-freshness problem
  a static, seeded demo dataset doesn't have, which is exactly the kind of unnecessary
  infrastructure complexity §8 of the assessment brief asks candidates to avoid (same
  reasoning as §9.2's rejection of async request submission). The correct lever to
  reach for once this is backed by a real, changing ticketing system, not before.

**Shared `logging_middleware.py`, deduplicated.** The structured-logging middleware
(request ID, method, path, latency, status — §7) was byte-identical across all 5
services. Rejected two more obvious fixes in favour of a third: a shared pip package
would introduce a runtime version-coupling dependency between services meant to stay
independently deployable; a Docker-build-context restructure (each service importing
a sibling directory) would break each service's independent local venv + `pytest`
workflow, since Docker build contexts are isolated per service by design. Instead,
`common/logging_middleware.py` is the single edited source, and
`scripts/sync-common.py` regenerates the 5 per-service copies — one real source of
truth to edit, with the file still physically present wherever each service's
`from app.logging_middleware import ...` and local test workflow expect it.
`sync-common.py --check` exits non-zero if any copy has drifted from the canonical
source, so a hand-edited copy can't silently diverge — designed to run as a CI gate
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml` drafts this), not yet confirmed running in a live CI
pipeline for this repo.

## 11. Testing strategy

- `recommendation-service`: unit tests on the scoring formula (pure functions, no I/O).
- `knowledge-service`: unit tests on search ranking for known queries.
- `agent-orchestrator`: unit tests on the Pydantic output schema validation and the
  ID-grounding check; one integration test that runs the full bounded
  plan→execute→synthesise flow (including the one-revision path) against the four
  downstream services mocked with `respx`, so CI never calls the real Anthropic API.
- Each REST service: a handful of endpoint tests via `httpx`'s `ASGITransport` against
  an in-memory/temp SQLite DB.
